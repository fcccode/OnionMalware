# OnionMalware
An example for a malware

# Features of the malware:

1. Evades Most AV Solutions
2. DLL Injection
3. Spreads in the network using PsExec (with the PsExecHandler module)
4. Kills Symantec AV remotely (can be used before Spreading in the network - to avoid being detected)
5. All necessary malicious resources inside it should be encrypted using my XOR encryption tool: https://github.com/gilmansharov/File-Encryptor-Decryptor , and then the malware decryptes them, saves them, using them, and deletes them.
6. Creates an EICAR file to test AV detections (It can be turned off).
7. Sends a HTTP GET request to a potential C&C server.



# HOW TO USE:

1. Build the PsExecHandler Module;
   Encrypt the original PsExec tool of SysInternals (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)
   using my encryption tool (https://github.com/gilmansharov/File-Encryptor-Decryptor) with a key for your choice (default: "INFECTED").
   After that, save the encrypted PsExec as a binary resource in the PsExecHandler Solution.

2. Build the M@lware;
   Encrypt the PsExecHandler file and A DLL for your choice (to be injected) using the same tool as before.
   Add the encrypted DLL and the PsExecHandler Tool as resources to the solution.
   
3. Have fun.
